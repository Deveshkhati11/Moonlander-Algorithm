# 🚀 MoonLander Algorithm – Reinforcement Learning Project

This project implements an intelligent agent for the **LunarLander-v2** environment using the **REINFORCE** policy gradient algorithm. The agent learns to land a spacecraft safely and efficiently on the moon's surface through trial and error, powered by reinforcement learning.

## 🌌 Overview

The LunarLander environment simulates a 2D landing scenario with physics-based challenges. The agent controls the main engine and side boosters to land the module on a designated landing pad without crashing or flying off-screen.

This project explores:
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Policy-based methods (REINFORCE)
- Environment interaction via OpenAI Gym
- Training neural network policies to learn control strategies

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)**:
  - Collects full episodes to compute returns
  - Updates the policy network using gradient ascent on expected rewards
- **Neural Network**:
  - Maps state observations to action probabilities
